## Why Not Oh My Zsh or Other Alternatives?

While Oh My Zsh is a fantastic framework for managing your Zsh configuration, ZSHBuddy aims to provide a more streamlined and performance-optimized experience with zero configuration required. 
By choosing ZSHBuddy, you get a powerful, modern, and efficient Zsh setup with minimal effort. Unlike Oh My Zsh, which loads all plugins on startup, ZSHBuddy leverages Antidoteâ€™s deferred plugin loading, ensuring a faster and smoother experience.

This setup is ideal for making VM shells feel like home instantly.
